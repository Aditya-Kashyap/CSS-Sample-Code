    The journey of life starts with a turning of a page. It feels alluring reading books. There are many little ways to enlarge our world and books are one of them. We write to be understood, speak to be heard and read to grow. A reader lives a a thousand years before he or she dies. Reading gives us some place to go when we have to stay where we are. This project is a small tribute from me to all the readers out there. Happy reading!
